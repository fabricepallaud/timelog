# Timelog
Time-tracking app which attempts to replicate much of the UI/UX of the excellent Harvest app (https://www.getharvest.com/) for non-commercial, demo purposes only.

#### Details
The app is built with Vue.js, Vuex & Vue-router. All user data is stored in Firebase. The UX is built with Vuetify. 

Sidenotes: Times are handled by the Moment.js library. Rows are instances of the same component, programmatically instantiated as user adds new rows.
